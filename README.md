# Project-Management-Project
This project shows and introduces my groups approach to a given scenario below and the solution to it.

Scenario: The Two Offices

• The board has established that the two offices located in Venice historical center are not
anymore good for company efficiency due to the high cost of maintenance and for the higher
cost of services

• The plan is to move all of them in a single office on the main land, creating a new datacenter and
transferring all the IT infrastructure actually present in the two historical palaces

• The new offices will be available in December 15th and the objective is to empty the current
locations by this year

• No downtime is allowed but the employees work on a 08:00 to 18:00 schedule, Monday to Friday

• Christmas vacation is scheduled from December 24th to January 6th so that none will access the
offices in that timeframe
